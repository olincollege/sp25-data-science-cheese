## Cheese Data Intro

**Background Information**

Source: <https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-06-04/readme.md>

*Sourcing and Credibility*

This project uses the dataset from the[ TidyTuesday: Cheese Week (June 4, 2024)](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-06-04/readme.md) initiative. The data is from Cheese.com, a long-standing online encyclopedia for cheeses, and was scraped by data scientist Thomas Mock and Jon Harmon for the purposes of public exploration and education.

This is a popular reference sites and is one of the largest cheese databases in the world, hosting extensive listings and descriptions of cheese worldwide. However, while it hosts a large amount of data, it is not academic nor industry-certified; thus, it introduces uncertainty about standardization and objectivity surrounding entries. Unfortunately, the original site's data-entry methodology is not transparent.

*Potential Errors, Uncertainties and Ambiguities*

With a lack of transparent data entry, this introduces potential errors in data classification. If the website was created through other available data sources or different customer entries, there could be potential errors in classification (e.g., inconsistent naming of regions, vague flavor descriptors) and missing values due to non-uniform entries across cheeses. Additionally, with a lack of transparency, there could be a bias in certain aspects of data entry. For example, it appears in this dataset that the United States of America produces the most kinds of cheese, with France and Italy at different points behind. However, France and Italy are renowned for being some of the top producers of cheeses worldwide with the United States always behind them.

This dataset is a non-random sample, containing \~1,200 cheeses documented on Cheese.com as of 2024. This does not represent the full global population of cheeses but is instead a convenience sampleâ€”limited to what has been posted/entered online. Therefore, selection bias is present. Well-known cheeses or those with wider international distribution are likely overrepresented. Regional or artisanal cheeses with less online presence may be underrepresented.

**Question and Exploration**

-   What question did you set out to answer?

-   What data did you find to help answer that question?
